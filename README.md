# The-Capitilization-Server
A simple "echo" server that simply replies to the client with the same text that it received. 
The application capitalizes the client's request before sending it back to the client.

The code allows the following usage:

1) The user starts the Server.

2) The user starts the Client.

3) The user types a string of text into the Client, which transmits it to the Server.

4) The Server capitalizes the string of text, and returns it to the Client.

5) The Client displays the capitalized text to the user.
